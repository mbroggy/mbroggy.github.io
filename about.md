If anything here is ever neglected...I apologize; reach out and smack me via GMail, FB or wherever.  I _intend_ to keep this pretty active...hopefully more so than any other project site I've started in the past...

Hi! I'm Michael.  I've been on-and-off programming (...mostly off...) for...well, since 1982.  While I started out programming (because what else could you do with a Sinclair ZX80?), most of my professional career has been more Linux administration/engineering/etc. than anything.  Still...there's always a component of programming (in scripting) in those roles.

This is me getting back to that, more deliberately.

It's been a long time since I've input programs by hand from magazines, on the ZX81, or figured out the necessary differences between BBC BASIC and Sinclair BASIC. Same with the Tandy Color Computer 3 versus C= 64, later, once we moved to the States; whatever computer I _had_, it never appeared to be the mainstream choice, so I always had work ahead of me if I were to consume other people's programs in via the available media at the time.

With the CoCo3, I got into BBSing (and to this day regret never running one, myself). When the internet hit my circle of high school friends, I was there first, encouraging everyone to figure out how to use whatever email they had available at school in order to keep in touch.

Since then, I've always been fascinated with the internet and computers in various forms.  Piping my home server access logs to a dot matrix printer, literally _listening_ for unauthorized access... Early in on smartphone adoption, I would administer Solaris systems while at the movies or dinner, via my Danger Hiptop.  Now? 4 Raspberry Pi 3s and two original Raspberry Pis sit, waiting for various moods to beat them into service.

Professionally, recent years have had me working on Puppet roles, Ansible playbooks, Jenkins and the like.  Not _too_ much call for things on that scale as a hobbyist, but I'm going to see what I can do with a virtual lab just to do it.  Mostly, now, what I want to focus on honing is Ruby, associated frameworks and maybe get into programming some longed-for projects I've had plenty of _interest_ in and just never enough motivation to get rolling.  

I mean, there's always something else vying for attention...

## Env

Mentioning a few things going into all of this; adding as things progress:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), my favorite code editor
* Developed either on a CentOS desktop, if I'm home (...because RedHat for work), or an Ubuntu Google Cloud Platform instance if I'm away.
